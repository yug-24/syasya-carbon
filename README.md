Problem Statement
The voluntary carbon market presents a significant opportunity for climate action, but it remains largely inaccessible to the most critical stakeholders in Indian agriculture: the smallholder farmers. Traditional Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) systems are prohibitively expensive, complex, and ill-suited for India's fragmented agricultural landscape, where 86.1% of farmers are small and marginal, owning less than two hectares of land. This high cost of entry systematically excludes the very farmers who are essential for scaling nature-based solutions like agroforestry and sustainable rice cultivation. ¬† 

Our Solution: The Hybrid dMRV Model
'S‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø-Carbon' (Syasya-Carbon) is a digital MRV (dMRV) platform designed from the ground up to solve this challenge. Our key innovation is a Hybrid dMRV Model that fuses high-tech automation with human-centric validation. ¬† 

High-Tech Automation: We leverage publicly available satellite imagery (e.g., Harmonized Landsat & Sentinel-2) and an AI/ML engine to provide continuous, low-cost monitoring of vast agricultural areas. This provides the scale. ¬† 

Human-Centric Validation: A simple, offline-first, vernacular mobile app empowers farmers and local field agents to capture targeted, geo-tagged ground-truth data (e.g., photos of newly planted trees, water levels in rice paddies). This provides the trust and accuracy.

This hybrid approach, inspired by successful last-mile data networks, drastically reduces verification costs by up to 70%, accelerates credit issuance by months, and builds a transparent, auditable data trail that enhances the integrity of the carbon credits generated. ¬† 

Crucially, our farmer-facing app is not just a data collection tool. It provides immediate, tangible value through features like hyperlocal weather forecasts and AI-powered pest alerts, driving consistent user engagement and ensuring a steady flow of high-quality data. ¬† 

Prototype Demonstration
We have developed a high-fidelity, interactive prototype to demonstrate the end-to-end functionality of our platform.

Key Features & Functionality
For Farmers & Field Agents (Mobile App):

Offline-First Functionality: Map farms and capture data without an internet connection.

Simple Evidence Capture: Geo-tag and time-stamp photos/videos as verifiable proof of practice.

Value-Added Services: Drive engagement with daily hyperlocal weather forecasts and AI-powered pest alerts. ¬† 

For Project Aggregators (Web Dashboard):

Geospatial Monitoring: Visualize all project farms on an interactive map with satellite data overlays.

Data Validation: Review and validate ground-truth data submitted from the field.

Automated Reporting: Generate audit-ready reports compliant with international standards.

For Auditors & Registries:

Digital Audit Trail: Secure, read-only access to a complete and transparent data history for every credit. ¬† 

Immutable Records: DLT-based ledger ensures data integrity and prevents double-counting. ¬† 

Compliance & Methodology
'S‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø-Carbon' is designed to be fully compliant with leading international carbon standards, ensuring the generation of high-integrity, high-quality carbon credits.

Agroforestry Projects: Our workflow aligns with Verra's VM0047 (Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation), specifically the "census-based approach" which is ideal for dispersed smallholder plantings like agroforestry. ¬† 

Rice Cultivation Projects: Our platform supports Gold Standard's "Methodology for Methane Emission Reduction by Adjusted Water Management Practice in Rice Cultivation," including its simplified approach for small-scale projects. ¬†
